[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/soapy/soapytest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/soapy/soapytest)

This is a package with lots of tests of the science within the Soapy simulation.

Feel free to add more if you have an idea for something that can be proven to work (or not work!)

The tests should be relatively small and self contained so that we can be sure individual componants are doing what we expect
